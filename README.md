# Main - Java Game Menu

This is the most basic Java Game.

This project is a simple Java Swing application that serves as a **game menu interface**. It includes a home screen with a logo, Play/Quit buttons, a gray game screen with a Back button, and hover effects with a hand cursor. It’s designed as a starting point for building a Java-based game.
